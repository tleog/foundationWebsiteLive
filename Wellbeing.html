            Going for a run, a swim or weight training exercises can help your
            body produce endorphins and dopamine. It's hard to get into a habit
            after work, so it might help to look for gyms with classes so you
            can sign up for sessions that work alongside your shifts.

            Take time for yourself. There may be times when you feel like you're
            not getting that much "you" time. For some, it can help to set time
            aside to do things that you enjoy, for example, hobbies, attending
            groups or even just watching a good TV show in the comfort of your
            home.
