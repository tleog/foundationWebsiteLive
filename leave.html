          In a nutshell, this is a two-year program where you will rotate between six different specialties between hospital and community. These rotations are chosen through a ranking system that opens towards the end of medical school. The ranking system allows you to choose rotations and locations based on your preferences. It has transitioned from a points-based system, where the highest rank gets first pick, to a 'best-fit' system. The 'best-fit' system aims to allocate everyone to one of their top choices, reducing the likelihood of being assigned a lower preference.        </div>

              SLEs, such as miniCEX and DOPS, are part of the 2021 curriculum, which does not specify a specific number required. However, you need enough evidence to demonstrate your capabilities. Note: your foundation school may suggest a certain number, for example, a minimum of 5 mini-CEX.            </li>
            <li>
              Reflections. Engage in reflections on events, cases, or scenarios that you encounter.            </li>
            <li>
              TAB, also known as 'Team Assessment of Behaviour,' is a requirement to demonstrate your value as a team member. This essentially involves multisource feedback, where you seek input from various members of the MDT. It's not too burdensome, provided you give people enough time and collect emails early.       
            <li>
              The Placement Supervision Group (PSG) is a form completed by senior staff, such as consultants in your specific rotation. This form aids in informing your clinical supervisor's end-of-placement report.            </li>
            <li>
              Self-directed learning: Attendance on modules or teaching that has
              value to you.

            <li>
              The Prescribing Safety Assessment (PSA) is a summative examination in F1 that you must pass.            </li>
            <li>
              Supervisor Reports: At the end of each attachment, you will meet with your clinical supervisor and educational supervisor to discuss the placement, address any concerns, and review your portfolio progress. They will assess your evidence against the required criteria, ultimately determining whether your performance is categorized as unsatisfactory, satisfactory, or exceptional – with 'satisfactory' indicating good performance.            </li>
            <li>
              Foundation Teaching: Attendance of a set number of hours may be required, which may be delivered in-house, such as on Wednesday afternoons. You can log these hours in your Personal Learning Log.            </li>

        <p class="leaveSubheader">What shifts will I work?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Shift work can vary depending on the specific job you rotate into. The two foundation years are divided into smaller rotations, totaling six (three per year), with each individual rotation lasting four months. The breakdown typically resembles the following, though it's not exhaustive:          
        </div>

          <div class="shiftGrid">
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Day Shift</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">Usually 9am-5pm +/- 1 or 2 hours</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Twilight</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              Examples include: 2pm-10pm, 4pm-12am
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">On call</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              Usually a 12 hour shift where you take referrals from 8am-8pm or
              8pm-8am.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Night Shift</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              8pm-8am where you will either cover wards (possibly with crash
              bleep) or are on-call.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Post take ward round</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              This is specific to surgery after an on-call shift the team will
              meet earlier to go through patients admitted overnight. Start
              times vary e.g. 7am-5pm shift.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Weekend</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              This can vary depending on responsiblities. Likely 8am-8pm ward
              cover or 8pm-8am ward cover nights.
            </div>
          </div>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">When can I go on holiday?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Unfortunately, taking leave is subject to employer policies, and it's generally harder to request time off during twilight shifts, night shifts, and weekends due to the need for adequate cover. Typically, you may need to arrange shift swaps with colleagues to secure these days off. Leave on normal workdays (e.g., 9 am-5 pm) depends on ward cover; if you're the sole staff member on the ward, it might not be permitted. For instance, if you're scheduled Mon-Thurs 9 am-5 pm but have weekend cover on Sat-Sun (with the following Mon off), you can take leave on Mon-Thurs but need to organize a swap for the weekend shifts. While shift swaps can be challenging, if you ask colleagues early, someone might be willing to exchange shifts. Planning early is advisable. However, organizing leave beyond four months can be challenging due to the rotation schedule, with new coordinators every four months. During each 4-month block, you're entitled to an average of 9 days of leave. Transferring leave is difficult and only permitted in exceptional circumstances, requiring agreement from seniors, rota coordinators, and potentially educational/clinical supervisors.        </div>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Other leave?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Study leave is crucial, providing dedicated time away from clinical duties for attending courses and conferences. It's important to check with your local trust on their study leave policies. In some rotations, FY1s may not have complete freedom in choosing its use, as it might be allocated for mandatory courses. Regarding bank holidays, these might not always be automatically granted, but if you work them, you'll receive time off in lieu.
        </div>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Time Off In Lieu (TOIL)</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) is granted only when you have worked more than your scheduled hours. In many trusts, you can only exception report (indicate that you have worked longer than expected) if you exceed a set time over what is expected. For instance, staying late over 30 minutes or missing dedicated teaching, such as F2 Teaching.Exception reporting is crucial for the success of TOIL and can also help raise concerns regarding excessive working hours. This process contributes to potential changes in local shift patterns and highlights the need for extra support.
