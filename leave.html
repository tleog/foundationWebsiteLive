          In a nutshell this a 2 year programme where you will rotate between
          six different specialties within two hospitals. These rotations are
          ones you will choose yourself through a ranking system. This ranking
          system opens towards the end of medical school and allowd you to
          choose which sets of rotations, and locations, are more suited to
          yourself. The ranking system has changed from points-based where
          whoever gets the highest rank gets first pick to a system of
          "best-fit".This will try to allocate everyone to one of their top
          choices. This reduces the liklihood of being sent somewhere really low
          down on your list.

          <ol class="leaveList">
            <li>
              SLEs e.g. miniCEX and DOPS. The 2021 curriculum states that there
              are not a specific number required however you need enough
              evidence to demonstratae capabilities. Note: your foundation
              school may suggest you do a certain number e.g. minimum 5
              mini-CEX.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reflections. Reflect on events/cases/scenarios you encounter.
            </li>
            <li>
              TAB akak multisource feedback. You will be required to do this to
              demontsrate that you are valued member of the team. This involves
              you asking for feedback from many members of the MDT. It's not too
              honourous as long as you give people enough time and collect
              emails early.
            </li>
            <li>
              Placement Supervision Group (PSG) is a form that senior staff e.g.
              Consultants in your specific rotation will complete a form which
              will help inform your clinical supervisor end of placement report.
            </li>
            <li>
              Self-directed learning: Attendance on modules or teaching that has
              value to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              PSA The prescribing safety assessment is a summative examination
              in F1 that you must pass.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supervisior reports. At the end of each attachment you will meet
              with your Clinical supervisor and educational supervisior to
              discuss how the placement has been, any concerns and your
              portfolio progress. They will compare your evidence against what
              is required before making a decision about whether you have
              either: unsasisfactory, satisfactory or exceptional performance.
              In this case Satisfactory is good.
            </li>
            <li>
              Foundation Teaching: You are required to attend 30 hours. This may
              be delivered in house e.g Wednesday afternoons. This can be logged
              in your Personal Learning Log.

        <p class="leaveSubheader">What shifts will I work?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Shift work can vary depending on the specific job you rotate into.
          Generally, the breakdown is something like below but it's not
          exhaustive:
          <div class="shiftGrid">
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Day Shift</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">Usually 9am-5pm +/- 1 or 2 hours</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Twilight</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              Examples include: 2pm-10pm, 4pm-12am
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">On call</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              Usually a 12 hour shift where you take referrals from 8am-8pm or
              8pm-8am.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Night Shift</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              8pm-8am where you will either cover wards (possibly with crash
              bleep) or are on-call.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Post take ward round</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              This is specific to surgery after an on-call shift the team will
              meet earlier to go through patients admitted overnight. Start
              times vary e.g. 7am-5pm shift.
            </div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item">Weekend</div>
            <div class="shiftGrid-item2">
              This can vary depending on responsiblities. Likely 8am-8pm ward
              cover or 8pm-8am ward cover nights.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">When can I go on holiday?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Unfortunately, you cannot take leave whenever you want. This will
          depend on employers however it is harder to take leave on twlightlight
          shifts, night shifts and weekend shifts due to cover. Normally, you'll
          have to do some shift swaps with colleagues to get these days off. You
          can take leave on normal days e.g. 9am-5pm dependent on ward cover. If
          it is only you on the ward sometimes the rota co-ordinators will not
          allow it as there might not be any cover. For example, lets say you're
          working Mon-Thursday 9am-5pm but are scheduled for weekend cover on
          Sat-Sun (with the following Mon off). You can take leave on the
          Mon-Thurs however you will have to organise a swap with a colleague
          for the weekend shifts. Swaps can be a challenge, the rotas are
          pre-made before you arrive however if you ask colleagues early there's
          bound to be someone who might do a swap, with you covering a shift for
          them on another date. Plan early if you can. That said it can be hard
          to organise leave more than four months into the future as you will
          rotate every 4 months, also rotating co-ordinators. Every 4 months you
          will get an average of 9 days leave that you should use within that 4
          month block. It is difficult to transfer leave and only done in
          exceptional circumstances that have to be agreed by seniors, rota
          co-ordinators and possibly educational/clinical supervisors.
        </div>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Other leave?</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          We've spoken about annual leave (AL) but there's also Study Leave and
          compassionat eleave to talk about.
