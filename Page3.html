        <p class="aboutText">Hello, my name is Tom.</p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          I am a Doctor working in the UK with a passion for medical education.
          After completing foundation training I decided to spend some years
          working as a teaching and research fellow. Within this role I have
          been involved with teaching all years of medical students from a
          UK-based medical school in and not limited to clinical, tutorial and
          lecture based teaching sessions covering a variety of topics. This
          role has been one of continuous learning and growth and has fuelled my
          enthusiasm for medical education. I firmly believe that knowledge
          should be passed on to the next generation of healthcare
          professionals, be it core medical knowledge or vital career and life
          advice when starting in such a field.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          In the week prior to starting as a junior doctor I had one small talk
          from a doctor breaking down the pay slip we would receive at the end
          of that same month. This information was brand new and it almost felt
          a bit last minute. This made me think, what other information did I
          learn on the job, or last minute prior to starting that could have
          been delivered prior?
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          As a result I have developed this platform as a project with the aim
          to help clinicians and medical students with topics that aren't always
          clear prior to starting or even during your job as a doctor.
