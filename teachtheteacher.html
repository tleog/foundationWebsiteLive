              Among the many roles of being a clinician is the role of being a
              teacher, mentor, or tutor. This is highlighted during your
              Foundation Training Years as you require evidence of your teaching
              role through the completion of a Developing the Clinical Teacher
              (DCT) form. It isn’t incredibly taxing to complete; however, it’s
              the way you complete it that is important. </p>
              <p class="train-Text-intro">

              Throughout medical
              school, I’m sure we’ve all experienced that teaching session that
              wasn’t “good” for whatever reason, be it the content, the
              presenter, or the setting. 
              </p>
              <p class="train-Text-intro">

              On this page, we’re
              going to cover a few key points on how we can improve our teaching
              to try to mitigate your students feeling the same way you did
              during that memorable session. This page is by no means
              exhaustive, but it will give you a flavor of how to improve your
              teaching styles. Some may be obvious, but how often is it not
              implemented? Let’s dive right in!

                    This pyramid can assist you in enhancing your teaching by
                    guiding the creation of learning objectives that are
                    specific and relevant to the cohort you are teaching. For
                    your beginner group, your objectives are likely to be
                    situated lower down the pyramid. For instance, you might
                    focus on having students apply a framework for classifying
                    Neck of Femur fractures. However, for your expert cohort,
                    you can aim to challenge them with objectives higher up the
                    pyramid. For instance, you might task them with evaluating
                    evidence or creating pieces of work, such as assessing
                    bleeding risk by comparing the use of ORBIT score to
                    HASBLED.

                    So, why Bloom's? By using terminology within the pyramid you can explain what you will do within your session. For example "To apply the knowledge of Advanced Life Support in managing your critically unwell patient."

                        Medical Education loves pyramids, so here's another. This is Miller's Pyramid of Clinical Competence. At the core, it's pretty basic but will allow you to organise and plan teaching sessions. In summary an expert will have the knowledge, skills and professional attitutes to naturally "do" something, for example lead an arrest call. However, your more novice student will be able to tell you how they would manage an arrest call. The difference is in the ability of the individual to deal with a real environment where all of the individual senses are naturally used, for example during the arrest call hearing stridor and fixing it with airway manoeuvres without spending lots of time recalling what to do. For more reading into the way experts think compared to beginners read about: Type 1 vs Type 2 Memory processing.
                      </p>
                      <p class="trainParagraph">
                        So, why is this important? So you can set learning outcomes. These are what the student will be able to do at the end of the session. For example "To be able to lead an arrest call within simulation."

                    We have both long-term and short-term (or working) memory.
                    Short-term memory is limited, typically to about 14 items,
                    while long-term memory may be virtually limitless. The aim
                    here is to transcribe information from the short-term into

                    Understanding this enables us to optimize content delivery
                    to students. To overcome limitations in working memory, we
                    should chunk information into sections for longer-term
                    storage. For instance, instead of presenting a list of
                    differentials for students to remember for abdominal pain,
                    you could teach them the surgical sieve, such as VITAMIN-C.

                  <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Check Understanding</p>
                  <p class="trainParagraph">
                    Ensure a baseline understanding for all students at the
                    start of a teaching session to optimize learning. For
                    example, when teaching a medical student on venous
                    cannulation, gauge their current knowledge before beginning
                    the lesson. Asking a baseline question, like recalling the
                    veins of the forearm, not only captures attention but also
                    helps tailor the session. Some students will be familiar,
                    others not, allowing for a brief recap to ensure everyone is
                    on a similar level. Repetition aids knowledge retention for
                    those familiar, while introducing new concepts to others.
                  </p>
                  <p class="trainParagraph">
                    Similarly, during sessions, regularly check your students'
                    understanding and revisit topics if needed. If uncertain
                    about their comprehension, politely ask them questions to
                    ensure they can explain concepts in their own words. This
                    facilitates point clarification before moving on.

                    Okay, you've captured their attention and brought the

                    information that detracts from core learning taking place
                    (the germane load). To optimize learning, we must reduce
                    extraneous load while enhancing intrinsic load (simplifying complexity of new content) to allow for processing and integration of new knowledge with previous learning (germane load). There are
                    many ways as a teacher you can reduce unnecessary
                    distractions from learning.

                      Reading text aloud that is already visible to students may
                      overload their language processing, involving both
                      auditory and visual pathways simultaneously. This can
                      result in presenting redundant information. Instead,
                      consider utilizing both visual and auditory pathways
                      concurrently. Returning to the cannulation example, you
                      can articulate the steps while displaying relevant images,
                      such as demonstrating the needle's positioning at a low
                      angle close to the vein. This approach engages students
                      more effectively than simply listing the steps on slides.
                      However, it's important to note that this strategy may
                      have exceptions, especially when presenting challenging or

                      Ensure that the content you discuss appears on slides
                      simultaneously as you present it. For instance, in a
                      pharmacology teaching session covering drug dosing
                      calculations, displaying the equation or an example
                      concurrently with the practice question is beneficial.
                      This use of 'transient information' is essential for
                      effective learning. If information is presented
                      sequentially, it becomes challenging for students to
                      recall details from the initial slides, leading to
                      increased mental effort, higher extraneous load, and
                      reduced intrinsic load (what the student learns).

                    <li class="trainParagraph">Split content into chunks:</li>
                    <p class="trainParagraph">
                      To enhance the student's learning experience, consider
                      breaking tasks into bite-sized chunks or steps. For
                      instance, with pharmacy slides, you could prompt students
                      to calculate the dose for the first hour before moving on
                      to the 24-hour calculation

                      Incorporate examples into your teaching strategy. For
                      novice learners, provide worked examples, while for more
                      advanced students, encourage problem-solving. To delve
