          Among the many roles of being a clinician is the role of being a teacher, mentor, or tutor. This is highlighted during your Foundation Training Years as you require evidence of your teaching role through the completion of a Developing the Clinical Teacher (DCT) form. It isn’t incredibly taxing to complete; however, it’s the way you complete it that is important.

          Throughout medical school, I’m sure we’ve all experienced that teaching session that wasn’t “good” for whatever reason, be it the content, the presenter, or the setting. On this page (a 5-minute read), we’re going to cover a few key points on how we can improve our teaching to try to mitigate your students feeling the same way you did during that memorable session. This page is by no means exhaustive, but it will give you a flavor of how to improve your teaching styles. Some may be obvious, but how often is it not implemented? Let’s try to change this.

          How can we teach more effectively?</p>
        <div class="train-Text-body">

            <li class="train-Text-subheader">1. Understand Bloom's Taxonomy</li>

                  This pyramid can assist you in enhancing your teaching by guiding the creation of learning objectives that are specific and relevant to the cohort you are teaching. For your beginner group, your objectives are likely to be situated lower down the pyramid. For instance, you might focus on having students apply a framework for classifying Neck of Femur fractures. However, for your expert cohort, you can aim to challenge them with objectives higher up the pyramid. For instance, you might task them with evaluating evidence or creating pieces of work, such as assessing bleeding risk by comparing the use of ORBIT score to HASBLED.                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="train-Text-subheader">2. Understand Cognitive Load Theory </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This theory underpins how the mind processes information, enabling us to optimize learning.                </p>
                <p>
                  We have both long-term and short-term (or working) memory. Short-term memory is limited, typically to about 14 items, while long-term memory may be virtually limitless.                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Chunking Information</p>
                <p>
                  Understanding this enables us to optimize content delivery to students. To overcome limitations in working memory, we should chunk information into sections for longer-term storage. For instance, instead of presenting a list of differentials for students to remember for abdominal pain, you could teach them the surgical sieve, such as VITAMIN-C.                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Check Understanding</p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Ensure a baseline understanding for all students at the start of a teaching session to optimize learning. For example, when teaching a medical student on venous cannulation, gauge their current knowledge before beginning the lesson. Asking a baseline question, like recalling the veins of the forearm, not only captures attention but also helps tailor the session. Some students will be familiar, others not, allowing for a brief recap to ensure everyone is on a similar level. Repetition aids knowledge retention for those familiar, while introducing new concepts to others.                </p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Similarly, during sessions, regularly check your students' understanding and revisit topics if needed. If uncertain about their comprehension, politely ask them questions to ensure they can explain concepts in their own words. This facilitates point clarification before moving on.                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Reducing Unnecessary Information</p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Okay, you've captured their attention and brought the students up to speed. Now, let's consider the 'extraneous load' in cognitive load theory, which refers to unnecessary information that detracts from teaching (the 'intrinsic load'). To optimize learning, we must reduce extraneous load while enhancing intrinsic load.

                  Start by considering the setting—lecture theatre, ward bay, side room, or online. Each has its distractions, but you can certainly work to minimize them.                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubsubheader">Reducing Extraneous load:</p>
                <ul class="teach-bullet-list">
                  <li>Reduce distractions in the room:</li>
                  <li>Avoid reading text directly from the slides during your presentation.</li>
                    <p>
                      Reading text aloud that is already visible to students may overload their language processing, involving both auditory and visual pathways simultaneously. This can result in presenting redundant information. Instead, consider utilizing both visual and auditory pathways concurrently. Returning to the cannulation example, you can articulate the steps while displaying relevant images, such as demonstrating the needle's positioning at a low angle close to the vein. This approach engages students more effectively than simply listing the steps on slides. However, it's important to note that this strategy may have exceptions, especially when presenting challenging or complex topics.                    </p>
                  <li>Avoid split-attention:</li>
                  <p>
                    Ensure that the content you discuss appears on slides simultaneously as you present it. For instance, in a pharmacology teaching session covering drug dosing calculations, displaying the equation or an example concurrently with the practice question is beneficial. This use of 'transient information' is essential for effective learning. If information is presented sequentially, it becomes challenging for students to recall details from the initial slides, leading to increased mental effort, higher extraneous load, and reduced intrinsic load (what the student learns).                  </p>
                  <!-- CONSIDER adding actual slides in for reference-->
                  <li>Split content into chunks:</li>
                  <p>
                    To enhance the student's learning experience, consider breaking tasks into bite-sized chunks or steps. For instance, with pharmacy slides, you could prompt students to calculate the dose for the first hour before moving on to the 24-hour calculation                    </p>
                  <li>Give hand-outs</li>
                  
                  <li>
                    Incorporate examples into your teaching strategy. For novice learners, provide worked examples, while for more advanced students, encourage problem-solving. To delve deeper into this concept, you can explore 'The expertise reversal effect.
