          Among the many roles of being a clinician is the role of being a teacher, mentor
          or tutor. This is highlighted during your Foundation Training Years as you require
          evidence of your teaching role through the completion of a Developing the Clinical
          Teacher (DCT) form. This isn’t incredibly taxing to complete however it’s the way
          you complete it that is important. 
          Throughout medical school I’m sure we’ve all experienced that teaching session that wasn’t “good”
          for whatever reason, be it the content, the presenter or the setting. Through this page (it is a 
          5 minute read) we’re going to cover a few key points on how we can improve our teaching to try to
          mitigate your students feeling the same way you did during that memorable session. This page is 
          by no means exhaustive but it will give you a flavour of how to improve your teaching styles. Some
          may be obvious but how often is it not actually implemented? Let’s try to change this.

                  This pyramid can help you improve your teaching by helping you to 
                  create learning objectives that are specific and relevant to the cohort 
                  you are teaching. For your beginner group your objectives are likely to 
                  lie lower down the pyramid. For example, having students apply a framework 
                  for classifying Neck of Femur fractures. However, for your expert cohort
                  you may be able to challenge them to evaluate evidence or create pieces of
                  work. For example, evaluating the use of ORBIT score compared to HASBLED 
                  when assessing bleeding risk.

              <li class="train-Text-subheader">2. Understand Cognitive Load Theory </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This is a theory underpinning how the mind processes information and by 
                  understanding this we can optimise what is learnt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To start we have our long-term memory and short-term (or working) memory. 
                  Our short-term memory is limited, usually to up to 14 items. However, our 
                  long-term memory may be endless.
                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Chunking Information</p>
                <p>
                  By knowing this we can think about the way we deliver content to students.
                  In order to overcome out working memory we should chunk information into sections 
                  to allow longer term storage. For example, instead of giving a list of 
                  differentials for the students to remember for abdominal pain you could teach them 
                  the surgical sieve e.g. VITAMIN-C.
                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Check Understanding</p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Ensure a baseline level of understanding for all students at the start of a teaching session.
                  This will optimise learning. For example, imagine you're teaching a medical student on the ward
                  who would like a refresher on how to perform venous cannulation? Now would be a good time to guage the 
                  student's current understanding before you start teaching. I'm sure we've all had teaching sessions where
                  the facilitator teaches, for what feels like ages about, something you already know. You can ask students a 
                  baseline question e.g. to recall veins of forearm. This could also be used to gain attention of your students
                  at the start of a session whilst making it interactive.
                  Some students will know it, some will not so now's the time to re-cap it briefly so everyone is at a similar level.
                  Repetition will help engrain the knowledge into the students who know whilst you teach others something new.
                </p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Similarly during sessions it's useful to check your students' understanding regularly and re-visit topics if required. If you’re 
                  not entirely sure they understand then you could politely as them a question to see if 
                  they can explain it in a way they understand. This allows point clarification before you 
                  move on.
                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubheader">Reducing Unnecessary Information</p>
                <p class="trainParagraph">
                  Okay, so you’ve caught their attention and brought the students up to speed. Now what?
                  We need to think about the “extraneous load” of cognitive load theory. Basically, this 
                  is the unnecessary information the students’ brains take in that detracts from your teaching
                  (aka the “intrinsic load”). Extraneous load needs to be reduced with intrinsic load (what the
                  student learns) optimised.
                  Firstly, think about the setting. Are you in a lecture theatre, ward bay, side room or on-line?
                  Think about all the different distractions that come from each of these. The list is practically
                  infinite but don’t be disheartened you can definitely help reduce it.
                </p>
                <p class="train-Text-subsubsubheader">Reducing Extraneous load:</p>
                <ul class="teach-bullet-list">
                  <li>Reduce distractions in the room:</li>
                  <li>Try not read out text on slides:</li>
                    <p>
                      By reading text that the students can see you may be "clogging-up" their language processing (or auditory)
                      pathway which text and speech both use simultaneously. Ultimately, you're presenting redundant information by doing this.
                      So, what you can do is to try to utilise the visual AND auditory pathways simultaneously. Let's return to our 
                      cannulation example. By talkin through the steps of cannulation with images. For example, presenting an image of when the  needle positioned
                      at a low angle close to the vein and you talk through the instead of listing them on the slides.
                      A caveat to this is when you are presenting a challenging or complex topic.
                    </p>
                  <li>Avoid split-attention:</li>
                  <p>
                    Ensure what you talk about appears on slides at the same time you talk about it.
                    For example, in a pharmacology teaching session where the students are learning new drug dosing calculations it would be beneficial
                    to have the equation (or an example) appear at the same time as the practice question. Now this example is basic however it's to show the use of "transient
                    information". Imagine you are presented the following slides in sequence, it's harder to remember what was on the initial slide to then complete the calculation.
                    As a result the student has to utilise extra mental effort to remember the first slide therefore increasing extraneous load and reducing the intrinsic load (what the student learns)
                  </p>
                  <!-- add actual slides in for reference-->
                  <p>
                    Slide 1: Total Required Dosage in 1 hour = Patient's Weight × Desired Dosage in 1 hour
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Slide 2: The patient weighs 70kg. The drug dose is 0.5mg/kg/hr. What dose does the patient need per 24 hours? 
                  </p>
                  <li>Split content into chunks:</li>
                  <p>In order to improve what the student learns it may be useful to split tasks into bitesized chunks or steps.
                    For example, with our pharmacy slides you could ask the students to calculate the dose in 1 hour first THEN do 24hours.
                    </p>
                  <li>Give hand-outs</li>
                  
                  <li>Use examples. For novices use worked examples but for more expert students use problem solving (If you want to look into this in more detail look up: "The expertise reversal effect".)</li>
