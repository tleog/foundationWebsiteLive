        <p class="leaveSubheader">How to document the ward round</p>

        <p class="aboutText">
          Before you read this page please note that there are many different ways on writing ward round notes. There is no correct way however you must remember that your notes should be:
          <ol class="leaveList">
            <li>1. Timely</li>
            <li>2. Accurate</li>
            <li>3. Understandable</li>
          </ol>
          I have put together an example of how to structure your notes when documenting during a ward round or after reviewing a patient.
          Usually, at the top of the page there is space for the patient identification sticker to be placed.

        <p class="leaveSubheader">Introductions and communication</p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          Start by introducing yourself with the phrase "Hello My Name is ____". This phrase has become commonplace in hospitals across the UK following a campaign started by Dr Kate Granger and her husband Chris.<a href="https://www.hellomynameis.org.uk/" style="color: blue;">Click here to read more.</a> Introducing yourself to your team and patients is polite, opens doors for communication and can even help settle your nerves.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Arrive Early</p>
        <p class="aboutText">
        Getting out of bed 5 minutes before a 9am lecture will be a thing of the past. In some departments it may be expected for you to have the patient list ready for 9am. As a result you will have to arrive at the hospital that bit earlier in order to update the list with any new patients that have arrived. If you are rushed for time the key thing to atleast have the patients on the list. Now this might not look good if their conditions aren't documented but it is safer than missing them entirely.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Familiarize Yourself with Local Protocols</p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          Each hospital may have its own set of protocols and guidelines. Take time to review these, especially those related to common procedures, emergency numbers, and local trust-specific practices. A really easy way to access local trust phone numbers is to use the Induction Switch App,  <a href="Appslist.html" style="color: blue;">visit the apps page.</a> 
       </p>
       <p class="leaveSubheader">Refering to Another Speciality</p>
       <p class="aboutText">
        This comes with practice, but a great tools to use will be that made by the team over at mindthebleep.com with their <a href="https://mindthebleep.com/referral-cheat-sheet/" style="color:blue">speciality referral cheat sheet</a>.

       <p class="leaveSubheader">Time Management & The Jobs List</p>
       <p class="aboutText">
        Efficient time management is a skill that takes time to develop. Prioritise tasks based on urgency and importance and don't hesitate to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed. Balancing multiple responsibilities is a common challenge, so by writing a jobs list you can stay on top of things.  
      </p>
      <p class="train-Text-subsubsubheader" style="margin-top: 5px;">Jobs List Example:</p>

        <img src="images\jobs.PNG" style="border-radius: 5px;"/>
        <p class="aboutText">In this example you can see that there are five jobs to do on this ward with each having differing degrees of completion. For jobs that require following up, for example if you require a CT scan then you need to first request the scan, then review and act on the results. These steps are shown by either half filling in the box or drawing a line through it. Different people have different ways. I prefer to colour in as it's more relaxing.</p>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Things to do at the end of the shift</p>
        <p class="aboutText">So, you've got through your first day on the job and you're about to leave. You can do a little bit more to help your team for the next day.
          It can be really useful to request blood tests for patients who need it. This way you can utilise the phlebotomy service (if applicable) and this can save time that may have been spent taking the bloods. It also helps by providing more information earlier in the day, optimising patient care. Often, for example on Fridays you may require bloods to be repeated over the weekend for a patient. This can be requested in a similar way but you may also have to "put out a job" (depending on trust software used) for the weekend Doctor to review these results. This process is similar for handing over non-urgent weekend jobs. For anything urgent it is important to try to attend the Handover Meeting (which indicates the start of the Night-Team's shifts).
