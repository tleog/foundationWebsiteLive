              Among the many roles of being a clinician is the role of being a
              teacher. This is highlighted during your Foundation Training Years
              as you require evidence of your teaching role through the
              completion of a Developing the Clinical Teacher (DCT) form. This
              can be done through a formal presentation or teaching session and
              allows you to prove your teaching skills.

            <p class="train-Text-intro">
              As you may already know it's not too hard to teach "badly" but it
              can be a challenge to teach "well". Try to think back to a lecture
              or teaching session that wasn’t “good” for whatever reason, be it
              the content, the presentation, or the setting.

            <p class="train-Text-intro">
              On this page, we’re going to cover a few key points on how we can
              improve our teaching to try to prevent your audience from feeling
              the same way you did during that memorable session. This page is
              by no means exhaustive, but it will give you a flavour of how to
              improve your teaching styles.

                    Bloom's Taxonomy (as shown in Figure 1) can assist you in
                    enhancing your teaching by guiding the creation of learning
                    objectives that are specific and relevant to the cohort you
                    are teaching.

                    For your beginner group, your objectives are likely to be
                    situated lower down the pyramid. For instance, you might
                    focus on having students summarise (remember and understand)
                    a framework for classifying Neck of Femur fractures.
                    However, for your expert cohort, you can aim to challenge
                    them with objectives higher up the pyramid. For instance,
                    you might task them with evaluating evidence between
                    operative management strategies.

                    Medical Education loves pyramids, so here's another. This is
                    Miller's Pyramid of Clinical Competence. In summary, this
                    pyramid helps us explain the difference between a Novice and
                    an Expert. An expert will have the knowledge, skills and
                    professional attitudes to naturally "do" something, for
                    example, lead an arrest call. However, a novice student will
                    be able to tell you how they would manage an arrest call.
                    The difference is in the ability of the individual to apply
                    this knowledge.

                    So, why is this important? When you consider what level of
                    student you are teaching you can optimise your teaching
                    style. So, if your students can already talk you through an
                    arrest call it may be beneficial to prepare a simulated
                    setting where they can show you. As a result, you can
                    continue to target your learning objectives to the level of
                    the learner. For example "To be able to apply knowledge of
                    Avdanced Life support in leading an arrest call in a
                    simulated environment."

                    When considering our memory, we have both long-term and
                    short-term (or working) memory. Short-term memory is
                    limited, typically to about 14 items, while long-term memory
                    may be virtually limitless. This is relevant in our teaching
                    setting because as we give information it's held in the
                    short-term memory.

                  <p class="trainParagraph">
                    To understand this, take a look at Figure 3 below. Firstly,
                    information is taken in from the environment. It is then
                    held in short-term memory where it is either stored in
                    long-term memory or lost.

                    Ensure a baseline understanding for all students at the
                    start of a teaching session to optimise learning. For
                    example, when teaching a medical student about venous
                    cannulation, gauge their current knowledge before beginning
                    the lesson. Asking a baseline question, like recalling the
                    veins of the forearm, can help capture the audience's
                    attention. Some students will be familiar, others not,
                    allowing for a brief recap to ensure everyone is on a
                    similar level. Repetition aids knowledge retention for those

                To overcome limitations in working memory, we should chunk
                information into sections of memory (called schemas) for
                longer-term storage. For instance, instead of presenting a list
                of differentials for students to remember for abdominal pain,
                you could teach them the surgical sieve, such as VITAMIN-C. Next
                time the student is asked about differential diagnoses they will
                recall the schema (VITAMIN-C) linked to this.

                To overcome limitations in working memory, we should chunk
                information into sections for longer-term storage. For instance,
                instead of presenting a list of differentials for students to
                remember for abdominal pain, you could teach them the surgical
                sieve, such as VITAMIN-C.

                    Okay, you've captured their attention and brought the
                    students up to speed. Now, let's consider the 'extraneous
                    load' in cognitive load theory, which refers to unnecessary
                    information that detracts from core learning taking place.
                    To optimise learning, we must reduce extraneous load while
                    enhancing intrinsic load (simplifying the complexity of new
                    content) to allow for the processing and integration of new
                    knowledge with previous learning for storage in long-term
                    memory.

                There are many ways you can reduce unnecessary distractions from
                learning:

                This includes that model skeleton in the corner, flip charts,
                posters, signs, and anything that is not directly related to
                your teaching. While it may not always be feasible to remove all
                posters or signs from the wall, you can minimize distractions.
                For instance, altering the environment, such as relocating
                students to an empty side room, may prove more effective than
                teaching in a ward bay.

                    Reading text aloud that is already displayed may overload
                    the students' language processing, involving both auditory
                    and visual pathways simultaneously. This can result in
                    presented information being redundant. Instead, consider
                    utilising both visual and auditory pathways at the same
                    time. Returning to the cannulation example, you can
                    articulate the steps while demonstrating the procedure. This
                    approach engages students more effectively than simply
                    listing the steps on slides.

                    Ensure that the content you discuss appears on slides
                    simultaneously as you present it. For instance, in a
                    pharmacology teaching session covering drug dosing
                    calculations, display the equation concurrently with the
                    practice question. If information is presented sequentially,
                    it becomes challenging for students to recall details from
                    the initial slides, leading to increased mental effort,
                    higher extraneous load, and a reduction in learning.
