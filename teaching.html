              Among the many roles of being a clinician is the role of being a
              teacher. This is highlighted during your Foundation Training Years
              as you require evidence of your teaching role through the
              completion of a Developing the Clinical Teacher (DCT) form. This
              can be done through a formal presentation or teaching session and
              gives you the opportunity to prove your teaching skills.

            <p class="train-Text-intro">
              As you may already know it's not too hard to teach "badly" but it
              can be a challenge to teach "well". Try to think back to a lecture
              or teaching session that wasn’t “good” for whatever reason, be it
              the content, the presentation, or the setting.

                    Bloom's Taxonomy (as shown in Figure 1) can assist you in
                    enhancing your teaching by guiding the creation of learning

                    For your beginner group, your objectives are likely to be

                    focus on having students summarise (remember and understand)
                    a framework for classifying Neck of Femur fractures.
                    However, for your expert cohort, you can aim to challenge
                    them with objectives higher up the pyramid. For instance,
                    you might task them with evaluating evidence between

                    Medical Education loves pyramids, so here's another. This is
                    Miller's Pyramid of Clinical Competence. In summary this
                    pyramid helps us explain the difference between a Novice and
                    Expert. An expert will have the knowledge, skills and
                    professional attitudes to naturally "do" something, for
                    example lead an arrest call. However, a novice student will
                    be able to tell you how they would manage an arrest call.
                    The difference is in the ability of the individual to apply
                    this knowledge.

                    So, why is this important? When you consider what level of
                    student you are teaching you can optimise your teaching
                    style. So, if your students can already talk you through an
                    arrest call it may be beneficial to prepare a simulated
                    setting where they can show you. As a result, you can
                    continue to target your learning objectives to the level of
                    the learner. For example "To be able to apply knowledge of
                    Avdanced Life support in leading an arrest call in a
                    simulated environment."

                    When considering our memory, we have both long-term and
                    short-term (or working) memory. Short-term memory is
                    limited, typically to about 14 items, while long-term memory
                    may be virtually limitless. This is relevant in our teaching
                    setting because as we give information it's held in the
                    short-term memory.

                  <p class="trainParagraph">
                    To understand this, take a look at Figure 2 below. Firstly,
                    information is taken in from the environment. It is then
                    held in short-term memory where it is either stored in long
                    term memory or lost.

                    Ensure a baseline understanding for all students at the
                    start of a teaching session to optimise learning. For
                    example, when teaching a medical student on venous
                    cannulation, gauge their current knowledge before beginning
                    the lesson. Asking a baseline question, like recalling the
                    veins of the forearm can help capture the audience's
                    attention. Some students will be familiar, others not,
                    allowing for a brief recap to ensure everyone is on a
                    similar level. Repetition aids knowledge retention for those

                    understanding while introducing new concepts to others.

                This includes that model skeleton in the corner, flip-charts,
                posters, signs and anything that is not directly related to your
                teaching. While it may not always be feasible to remove all
                posters or signs from the wall, you can minimise distractions.
                For instance, altering the environment, such as relocating
                students to an empty side-room, may prove more effective than
                teaching in a ward bay.

                    Reading text aloud that is already may overload the
                    students' language processing, involving both auditory and
                    visual pathways simultaneously. This can result in presented
                    information being redundant. Instead, consider utilising
                    both visual and auditory pathways at the same time.
                    Returning to the cannulation example, you can articulate the
                    steps while demonstrating the procedure. This approach
                    engages students more effectively than simply listing the
                    steps on slides.

                    Ensure that the content you discuss appears on slides
                    simultaneously as you present it. For instance, in a
                    pharmacology teaching session covering drug dosing
                    calculations, display the equation concurrently with the
                    practice question. If information is presented sequentially,
                    it becomes challenging for students to recall details from
                    the initial slides, leading to increased mental effort,
                    higher extraneous load, and a reduction in learning.
