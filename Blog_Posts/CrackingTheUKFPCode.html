  How to navigate the preference-informed allocation (PIA) system
</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  The final year of medical school is an intense, emotional, but rewarding time.
  It can sometime feel overwhelming with exams, electives, placement and
  preparing for life as a junior doctor all thrown into the mix – and that’s
  without even thinking about applying to the UK foundation programme.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  The recent introduction of preference-informed allocation (PIA) has likely
  added a layer of uncertainty and anxiety for many of us as we begin to rank
  our deaneries. To make things a bit more challenging, the Oriel application
  system – while functional – isn’t exactly known for being user-friendly, which
  can heighten the stress of an already demanding process.
</p>
<p class="p-blog">
  This blog aims to bring some clarity to the PIA system and offer guidance on
  key factors to consider when submitting your preferences.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">What is Preference-Informed Allocation?</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  The 2024 UKFP introduces a relatively new system called preference-informed
  allocation (PIA). No longer will applicants be allocated based on their
  Educational Performance Measure (EPM) or Situational Judgement Test (SJT)
  scores. Instead, each applicant is given a computer-generated rank, which is
  entirely random and not influenced by academic performance, designed to give
  as many applicants as possible their first-choice Foundation School.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">How Does the Two-Pass System Work?</h2>

<h2 class="h2-blog"></h2>

<ul class="ul-blog">
  <p class="p-blog">
    <strong>1. First Pass: </strong><br />In this phase, the algorithm works
    through applicants in order of their computer-generated ranks. If there are
    places available at an applicant’s first-choice Foundation School, they are
    allocated a place. If the applicant’s first choice is full, the system skips
    them and moves on to the next ranked applicant. This process continues until
    the list of applicants has been completed.
  </p>
  <li class="li-blog">
    <p class="p-blog">
      <strong>2. Second Pass: </strong> <br />Any applicants who were not placed
      in their first-choice Foundation School during the first pass are
      considered again. This time, they are allocated to the highest-ranked
      Foundation School on their list that still has available places.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p-blog">
  While other factors, such as applications to the Specialised Foundation
  Programme (SFP), Foundation Priority Programme (FPP), or eligibility for
  pre-allocation due to personal circumstances, can influence where you are
  allocated, the focus of this article is on factors to consider when ranking
  deaneries via the traditional route.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">
  Preferencing your Foundation Schools – 3 things to consider
</h2>

<ul class="ul-blog">
  <p class="p-blog">
    <strong>1. Evaluate what contributes most to your happiness </strong><br />
    This might seem obvious, but it’s important to think carefully about what
    will make you happiest both personally and professionally. Whether it’s
    proximity to loved ones, easy access to nature, or the vibrant life of a big
    city, your personal well-being is just as important as your career
    development. Choose a location that aligns with your lifestyle and values.
  </p>

  <li class="li-blog">
    <p class="p-blog">
      <strong>2. Understand the competition</strong> <br />
      Some deaneries are far more competitive than others—think London, Severn,
      Oxford, North West, and West Midlands Central! If you’re considering a
      highly sought-after deanery with a high competition ratio, bear in mind
      that your chances of being allocated there are significantly lower unless
      you rank it as your first choice. It’s crucial to be realistic and balance
      ambition with practical considerations.
    </p>

      <strong
        >3. Explore research opportunities and leading specialties offered by
        tertiary centres in the region
      </strong>
      <br />If you have a keen interest in a niche specialty, it’s worth
      considering Foundation Schools associated with hospitals that are renowned
      centres for that specialty. This increases your chances of gaining
      exposure or securing a rotation in your desired field, which can be
      invaluable when building your portfolio through specialty taster sessions
      or other hands-on opportunities that may arise.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p-blog">
  Applying to the UKFP 2024 through the preference-informed allocation system
  may seem daunting, especially with a process that feels unfamiliar and out of
  your control. However, by carefully considering your preferences and applying
  a strategic approach, you can increase your chances of landing in a location
  that suits both your personal and professional needs.
</p>

<p class="p-blog contact-info">
  Wishing you all the best of luck with your application! No matter where you
  end up, remember that every Foundation School offers valuable opportunities,
  and this is just the start of an exciting journey into your medical career.
