<h1 class="h1-blog">Reflections on Transitioning to an F1 Doctor</h1>

<p class="p-blog">
  My name is <strong>Sam Redfern</strong>, and I am a Foundation Year 2 (F2)
  Doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust. During my F1 training, I
  rotated through paediatrics, diabetes and endocrinology, and general surgery.

<p class="p-blog">
  With the new cohort of Foundation Year 1 Doctors (F1’s) beginning this last
  August, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on one of the scarier moments of
  recent times – the transition from final year medical student to a foundation
  year 1 doctor.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">The Transition from Medical Student to F1 Doctor</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  This is something that dawns on every final year medical student upon
  realising they have finally successfully navigated medical school. There is
  excitement and anxiety to this realization. After spending four, five, six, or
  even more years grinding through medical school— from early years embryology
  lectures to starting clinical placements and revising for your final
  OSCEs—you’ve now reached the beginnings of your career as a doctor.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  I can still remember the fears I had before starting my F1, so through this
  blog post, I hope to discuss and pass on to you a few things I wished I knew
  before starting. I hope this can provide some reassurance to all new F1
  doctors.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Remember, You’re Not Alone</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  If you’re going to remember anything when it comes to starting your F1 post,
  remember this—you are all in the same boat! It can be easy to fall into the
  trap of thinking that you, alone, are the only one struggling. Every F1 will
  find different elements of the job difficult, and every F1 will take a varying
  amount of time to settle into their new roles. Allow yourself time to build
  your confidence and adjust to full-time work—it won’t come instantly! Chatting
  with fellow F1’s can be helpful; either because they may share your struggle
  or they may know a way to help you.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Don’t Be Afraid to Ask</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  Everyone has to learn; you aren’t going to know how to do everything on day
  one or know where everything is on the ward. All the members of the wider MDT
  will likely have been there for a good amount of time, and asking them will be
  key. Everyone is happy to help you and answer any questions—they will know you
  are new and expect the new F1s to take a little time to find their feet and
  adjust to a new working environment.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  I personally find a lot of the joy of medicine comes from the interactions I
  have with patients and my colleagues. Your colleagues are the ones who get you
  through a rough day, who come to support you when the day has been tough, and
  who pick you back up and get you back on the right path. Don’t underestimate
  how important they are to your day-to-day working life.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  Along with this comes getting support from senior colleagues. If you are
  unsure of something clinical and are not confident in making a decision,
  please discuss it with a more experienced colleague. Although you have many
  years of medical school knowledge, some real-world situations may be new to
  you, and you may not have all the relevant experience to deal with a certain
  situation or make a fully informed and confident decision. This will come with
  time and experience, and you will never find out the correct way to handle a
  situation if you don’t ask!
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Take Time to Step Away</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  Allow yourself time to take a step away from work and medicine. Some of you
  will start with very hectic and busy schedules, and if you are starting your
  first full-time job, this can take its toll. Late shifts, night shifts, and
  long weekends can be physically and mentally exhausting, especially when
  starting in a new position where everything may be unfamiliar and
  overwhelming.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  It is vital that during your off time, you take time to sleep, relax, and do
  the things you enjoy. Don’t neglect the things that make you happy, whether
  that be going to the gym, playing sports, seeing friends, or any other hobbies
  you enjoy; these are essential for avoiding burnout at work. In addition, it
  is important to get your annual leave in relatively early; ensure you spread
  your leave throughout the 4-month rotation. Everyone will be different, but
  taking regular breaks from work by using annual leave will prevent everything
  from becoming too busy. Locum shifts can be available for F1 doctors if you
  have worked in the area previously; feel free to take them if you like, but
  again, ensure you give yourself enough time to properly recharge from your
  standard rota.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Start Filling Your Portfolio Early</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  Start filling up your portfolio early; take the opportunities when available
  to discuss topics, examine patients, or perform procedures in the presence of
  senior colleagues to start building up your portfolio. This will save you from
  bugging senior colleagues late in the rotation for your mandatory sign-offs.
  Doing a little bit of portfolio work once a week or so makes the whole year
  more manageable and prevents the stress of last-minute portfolio work as the
  ARCP deadline approaches. Use your allocated study days wisely for workshops,
  courses, taster sessions, or just to spend time building your portfolio.
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Make the Most of Your Shadowing Week</h2>

<p class="p-blog">
  Your shadowing week prior to starting your F1 post is invaluable. Shadowing an
  F1 for a week before starting gives you a week of supervised F1 work. Ask all
  those small questions then—no question is too silly. You will be shadowing
  F1’s who have been doing your specific job for almost 4 months and doing the
  F1 job for almost a year; they can give you the ins and outs of the job and
  teach you all the basics for the day-to-day working shift.
</p>

<p class="p-blog">
  Get to grips with all relevant IT systems and ensure you feel confident with
  them prior to starting—this takes a lot of stress away from day one on the
  wards. Don’t shy away from any jobs that come up in this shadowing week—it
  will be you who must do them once the old F1’s have moved on, so get the
  practice in early. You can’t learn everything in a week, but do make the most
  of this shadowing period; you won’t get it again!
</p>

<h2 class="h2-blog">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul class="ul-blog">
  <li class="li-blog">
    <strong>Be kind to yourself:</strong> Finding that work/life balance can be
    hard. Maintain hobbies outside of work and allow yourself to step away from
    the world of medicine.
  </li>
  <li class="li-blog">
    <strong>You have support:</strong> Whether through your supervisor, other
    members of your ward team, your consultant, or your fellow F1’s, don’t be
    afraid to ask for help.
  </li>
  <li class="li-blog">
    <strong>Make the most of your shadowing period:</strong> Ask those questions
    before day one!
  </li>
  <li class="li-blog">
    <strong>Cut yourself some slack:</strong> You can’t expect to know
    everything on day one!
  </li>
  <li class="li-blog"><strong>If you’re not sure, ask!</strong></li>
  <li class="li-blog"><strong>Do your portfolio little and often.</strong></li>
  <li class="li-blog">
    <strong>Be kind to ALL your colleagues:</strong> Not just other doctors.
  </li>
  <li class="li-blog"><strong>You’ve got this!</strong></li>
</ul>

  As a closing note, I wish you all good luck for your first year of foundation
  training and all the very best for your future careers.
