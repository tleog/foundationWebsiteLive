          In a nutshell, this is a two-year training program for new medical
          graduates. It was designed to allow for a more uniform healthcare
          service across the United Kingdom. Typically, you will rotate between
          six different specialties between hospital and community. During these
          rotations you are required to demonstrate your progression through
          domains correlating proffessional and clinical competencies (see
          below).

          As of June 2023 it was decided that allocations will be based through
          a system called the "Preference Informed Allocation" (PIA). The
          'best-fit' system aims to allocate everyone to one of their top
          choices, reducing the likelihood of being assigned a lower preference.
          The PIA system means that the previously used Situational Judgement
          Test and Educational Performance Measure (EPM) (aka your medical
          school ranking) no longer count. Read on for a step-by-step overview
          of the process:

          Yes, but you will be allocated by the lower rank of both applications.

          applicants in the same area then the applications will become
          UN-linked and ranked seperately.

        <div class="leaveFaq">
          But, you said that we aren't "ranked" according to our ability so why
          do you mention ranking?
        </div>
        <div class="leaveText">
          You're correct, within the PIA system a rank is still generated for
          each applicant. This is a computer generated rank by the Oriel system
          as the algorithm is run to best match individuals. This has nothing to
          do with your performance at medical school.

            for you to show that you are a safe and professional clinician. This

          you may need to arrange shift swaps with colleagues to secure these
          days off. Leave on normal workdays (e.g., 9 am-5 pm) depends on ward
          cover; if you're the sole staff member on the ward, it might not be
          permitted. For instance, if you're scheduled Mon-Thurs 9 am-5 pm but
          have weekend cover on Sat-Sun (with the following Mon off), you can
          take leave on Mon-Thurs but need to organize a swap for the weekend
          shifts. While shift swaps can be challenging, if you ask colleagues
          early, someone might be willing to exchange shifts. Planning early is
          advisable.

          Alongside this it's important to note that organising leave four
          months in advance can be challenging due to the job rotation schedule.
          Alongside this there will be new rota coordinators every four months
          so make sure you contact the correct person! During each 4-month
          block, you're entitled to an average of 9 days of leave. Transferring
          leave is difficult and only permitted in exceptional circumstances,
          requiring agreement from seniors, rota coordinators, and potentially
          educational or clinical supervisors.

          Study leave is crucial, providing dedicated time away from clinical
          duties for attending courses and conferences. It's important to check
          with your local trust on their study leave policies. In some
          rotations, FY1s may not have complete freedom in choosing its use, as
          it might be allocated for mandatory courses. During your F2 year and
          beyond you might have more flexibility with this, check local policy.
          Regarding bank holidays, don't always presume you'll hvae it free as
          you may be rota'd in to work them. If you do end up working them then
          you'll receive time off in lieu to take at a later date.

        <p class="leaveSubheader">Time Off In Lieu (TOIL)</p>
        <div class="leaveText">
          Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) is granted only when you have worked more than
          your scheduled hours. In many trusts, you can only exception report
          (indicate that you have worked longer than expected) if you exceed a
          set time over what is expected. For instance, staying late over 30
          minutes or missing dedicated teaching, such as scheduled Foundation
          Teaching. Exception reporting is crucial for the success of TOIL and
          can also help raise concerns regarding excessive working hours. This
          process contributes to potential changes in local shift patterns and
          highlights the need for extra support so exception report at every
          opportunity.

          What happens if I work when the clocks change?
        </div>
        <div class="leaveText">
          When the clocks change, for Daylight saving time (DST) and British
          summer time (BST), you'll either love it or hate it. In spring, as the
          clocks go forward it essentially means that you work one less hour
          that shift! However, in October, with DST the clocks go back one hour
          meaning that you have to work that extra hour with no extra pay.
