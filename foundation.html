        <p class="leaveText">
          In a nutshell, this is a two-year training program for new medical
          graduates. It was designed to allow for a more uniform healthcare
          service across the United Kingdom. It is organized by the UK
          Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO), which manages the national
          application process, provides guidance on foundation training, and
          ensures consistency among programs. When considering the contents of
          the training, typically, you will rotate between six different
          specialities within hospitals and the community. During these
          rotations, you are required to demonstrate your progression through
          domains correlating professional and clinical competencies (see
          below).

        <p class="leaveText">
          As of June 2023, it was decided that allocations would be based on a
          system called the "Preference Informed Allocation" (PIA). The
          'best-fit' system aims to allocate everyone to one of their top
          choices, reducing the likelihood of being assigned a lower preference.
          The PIA system means that the previously used Situational Judgement
          Test and Educational Performance Measure (EPM) (aka your medical
          school ranking) no longer count. Read on for a step-by-step overview
          of the process:

        <p class="leaveText">
          This was previously called the Academic Foundation Programme. These
          jobs allow you to get involved in teaching, medical research and
          leadership opportunities alongside the mandatory competencies of
          foundation training. A clinical job may be swapped out for a research
          job, for example.

        <p class="leaveFaq">Foundation Priority Programme (FFP)?</p>

        <p class="leaveText">
          These jobs generally involve recruitment to less popular areas with
          the trainee possibly being paid a monetary incentive. Just like the
          standard Foundation Programme, you will have to commit to an area for
          the entirety of training however, these are commonly in more rural
          areas and areas with a shortage of clinicians and resources.

          No, and you cannot appeal your allocation if you aren't happy with it

        <p class="leaveFaq">Can I match my application with someone else?</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Yes, but you will be allocated by the lower rank of both applications.
          However, not all Foundation Schools allow matching. Take a look at the

          information. If the PIA system can't rank both applicants in the same
          area then the applications will become UN-linked and ranked
          separately.
        </p>

        <p class="leaveFaq">
          But, you said that we aren't "ranked" according to our ability so why
          do you mention ranking?
        </p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          You're correct, within the PIA system, a rank is still generated for
          each applicant. This is a computer-generated rank by the Oriel system
          as the algorithm is run to best match individuals. This has nothing to
          do with your performance at medical school.

        <p class="leaveFaq">What's the process for SFP and FPP applications?</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          To apply for Specialist Foundation Placements the process will also
          not use SJT or EPM but will produce its own independent
          computer-generated ranking system. Alongside this, there are five
          free-text questions that you will have to answer to evaluate your
          suitability, motivation and skills.

            not done yet – but don't panic, they're not that bad. To gain full
            GMC registration (at the end of F1 year) and to show continual
            professional development throughout your training it is required for
            you to show that you are a safe and professional clinician. This is
            done through a set of mandatory sign-offs which will have to be done
            every year. As you go into speciality training these will change
            depending on the speciality.

          Am I expected to be running a ward on day 1?!
        </p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Don't panic! For FY1, it's mandatory to have a shadowing period of
          roughly 1 week. During this time you will meet the team; complete
          mandatory induction requirements, and shadow the F1 you will be taking
          over from.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          You are advised not to book any time off in this period, for any
          reason and it is usually the week before the first Wednesday in
          August.
        </p>

        <p class="leaveSubheader">When can I go on holiday?</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Unfortunately, taking leave is subject to employer policies, and it's
          generally harder to request time off during twilight shifts, night
          shifts, and weekends due to the need for adequate cover. Typically,
          you may need to arrange shift swaps with colleagues to secure these
          days off. Leave on normal workdays (e.g., 9 am-5 pm) depends on ward
          cover; if you're the sole staff member on the ward, it might not be
          permitted. For instance, if you're scheduled Mon-Thurs 9 am-5 pm but
          have a weekend cover on Sat-Sun (with the following Mon off), you can
          take leave on Mon-Thurs but need to organize a swap for the weekend
          shifts. While shift swaps can be challenging, if you ask colleagues
          early, someone might be willing to exchange shifts. Planning early is
          advisable.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Alongside this, it's important to note that organising leave four
          months in advance can be challenging due to the job rotation schedule.
          Alongside this there will be new rota coordinators every four months
          so make sure you contact the correct person! During each 4-month
          block, you're entitled to an average of 9 days of leave. Transferring
          leave is difficult and only permitted in exceptional circumstances,
          requiring agreement from seniors, rota coordinators, and potentially
          educational or clinical supervisors.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Study leave</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Study leave is crucial, providing dedicated time away from clinical
          duties for attending courses and conferences. It's important to check
          with your local trust on their study leave policies. In some
          rotations, FY1s may not have complete freedom in choosing what to use
          it for, as it might be allocated for mandatory courses. During your F2
          year and beyond you might have more flexibility with this, check local
          policy.
        </p>
        <p class="leaveSubheader">Sick Leave</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          If you're not fit to work for whatever reason, you can take sick
          leave. This can be up to 7 days of self-certified leave before you
          need to get a "fit note" (previously called sick note) from your
          clinician. If you find yourself taking lots of sick leave then you
          might be required to have a meeting with your Educational Supervisor
          to check in and consider if extra time is required for you to reach
          the required competencies to pass the Foundation Year. Each department
          might have slightly different policies but the basics involve you
          contacting the consultant and/or rota co-ordinator so your work will
          be covered.
        </p>

        <p class="leaveSubheader">Bank Holidays</p>

        <p class="leaveText">
          Regarding bank holidays, don't always presume you'll have it free as
          you may be rota'd in to work them. If you do end up working them then
          you'll receive time off in lieu to take at a later date.
        </p>

        <p class="leaveSubheader">Time Off In Lieu (TOIL)</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) is granted only when you have worked more than
          your scheduled hours. In many trusts, you can only exception report
          (indicate that you have worked longer than expected) if you exceed a
          set time over what is expected. For instance, staying late for over 30
          minutes or missing dedicated teaching, such as scheduled Foundation
          Teaching. Exception reporting is crucial for the success of TOIL and
          can also help raise concerns regarding excessive working hours. This
          process contributes to potential changes in local shift patterns and
          highlights the need for extra support so exception report at every
          opportunity.

        <p class="leaveFaq">What happens if I work when the clocks change?</p>
        <p class="leaveText">
          When the clocks change, for Daylight saving time (DST) and British
          Summer Time (BST), you'll either love it or hate it. In spring, as the
          clocks go forward it essentially means that you work one less hour
          that shift! However, in October, with DST the clocks go back one hour
          meaning that you have to work that extra hour with no extra pay.
